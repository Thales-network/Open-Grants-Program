## Project Overview  

### Overview
#### Tag line
* **Thales：a distributed autonomous online Algorithm-based central bank system based on Polkadot.**

#### Introduction
* A purely peer-to-peer version of the system would allow online citizens to participate in blockchain economics & society democratically, transparently.

* There are three important things in Thales, the first one is a new paradigm of a distributed-autonomous-economic system called Hayek, the second one is a scalable distributed-autonomous-society system called Plato, the third one is a user-based framework for common blockchain users called Turing.

* We all agree that blockchain-based internet will become predominant, but there is still a long way to go. Thales is trying to simulate the real-world social & economic system in a blockchain way. In Thales, anyone can be anything.

* The fundamental idea in Plato: Democratically & transparently are the most important things in a society, there is no perfect society system, Democraticly & transparently make the society iterable，It is an iteration that makes the system infinitely close to the ideal system.

* The fundamental idea in Hayek: Asset and currency are different things, an autonomous economic system needs them all, but they have different logic. A percentage is more important than an amount both in Asset and currency.  Fixed price is a big mistake，we need percentage price. Distribution is everything, especially in a blockchain economic system.

* The fundamental idea in Turing: The user experience matters. Developer-based blockchain is a big mistake that impedes the development of the blockchain, users need user-based blockchain. blockchain should provide Stepped-decentralized productions for users.

#### why Polkadot？
* Our team once wanted to make a cross-chain infrastructure similar to Polkadot in 2018, and then create an algorithmic central bank based on this infrastructure. The name of the project is IPS (https://github.com/Cryptofk/IPS_Whitepaper), But then the team abandoned the project because it was too difficult to implement an infrastructure similar to Polkadot. We have been following the progress of Polkadot. When we saw the news that Polkadot was about to go online, we were very excited because we can finally focus on the implementation of our algorithmic credit currency logic instead of the underlying infrastructure. So our team restarted this project and renamed it Thales.

* In Thales's system, the design is a dual-token mechanism. One of the tokens, THALA, is the fuel that drives the operation of the system, similar to Ethereum's ETH, and at the same time, the system's digital gold is similar to BTC. Another token, ECHO, is an algorithmic credit currency that is adjusted in  real-time based on an algorithmic central bank algorithm.

* Such a system design requires a public chain as technical support. Polkadot's secure sharing mechanism is exactly what we need, which reduces the difficulty of building a public chain and improves security. So we plan to build a parachain on Polkadot to host our algorithmic central bank.

* Substrate is a simple and efficient public chain development framework. Using it to modularly build a public chain is an undoubted choice.

#### why Thales？
* We have always believed that Bitcoin is not a digital currency but a digital asset. Because the basic function of the currency is to serve as the transaction medium and value scale, while the basic function of assets is to maintain and increase value. People need assets as well as currency in their daily lives. We believe that the system can only be pushed forward with decentralized system currencies and assets as gas together to push the system continuously forward. However, the underlying economic logic of currency and assets is completely different and must be issued separately. Articles or charts comparing Bitcoin to gold are already very common.

* All options of Bitcoin have indicated a higher value than gold. The end of the gold standard monetary system is not merely because of the difficulty of carrying higher circulation costs and cutting apart but more because the total amount of gold is limited. Although the gold trading volume in the London gold trading market far exceeds the underground gold reserves, the paper gold can be manufactured at will and the precise total storage of gold is still unknown, in the public's perception, the total amount of gold is limited. Any goods with a limited total amount can only be an asset that may be used as a currency in a very short time, but not in the long-term. The historical evolution of gold to credit currencies, correspondingly to the digital currency, The digital assets such as Bitcoin will inevitably transfer the functions of the transaction medium by a new global digital currency with stable and adjustable supply, only retaining the attributes of the digital asset, as well as the hard currency function in a critical time.

* Given such economic understanding, we designed a parallel dual-currency economic system called Hayek, stable currency ECHO and digital asset THALA. This value stability is not like DAI, the anchored currency, nor USDT which is endorsed by the legal currency but achieved through a transparent issuance and destruction mechanism to strictly control the currency supply.

* Our team believes that BTC has not realized Satoshi Nakamoto's vision. BTC is not a peer-to-peer electronic currency, but a peer-to-peer electronic asset. We want to create a real electronic currency system. This is the ultimate goal of the team.
We have given a plan based on our understanding of the central banking system, credit currency, currency, economics, and sociology. We want to establish an algorithmic central bank first, and then issue algorithmic credit currency based on the algorithmic central bank.

#### ECHO System
 * We have adopted a completely new dual currency system because Edison, the designer of this economic system, a well-known economist and Sociologist does not agree with the definition of currency in traditional economics. The most important point is that currency cannot have the function of trading media and value storage at the same time. The most essential function of currency can only be transaction medium, while and the storage of value is the function that only assets can possess. Therefore, we have designed two currencies in the system. The currency used as the trading medium is ECHO . The ECHO itself is a stable currency, of which the stability is not achieved by anchoring the currency but by adjusting the supply of money. The other currency, THALA, is designed for value storage. Any item that serves as value storage can only be an asset, and only items that have limited supplies (or are generally considered to have limited supplies) have value storage capabilities. 

 * In the decentralized world, there has never been a greater need for a 
stable digital currency than this moment, with stability instead of fixed, which has been criticized by some of the so-called scholars for the excessive speculation of digital money, but not a global digital currency that penetrates daily life. Fortunately, the underlying architecture of Thalesmakes it possible for the large-scale application of decentralized systems, and it is only in this case that the emergence of a universal digital currency in the bit world becomes possible. 

* In the mechanism design of ECHO, we have not only designed a new currency supply adjustment mechanism but also designed a brand new credit system based on the trading day. ECHO aims to become a daily digital currency and a universal digital currency that only has transaction medium functions with self-regulate, and also has a reliable credit system. For details, please refer to our currency_whitepaper. Believe it will give you a bright feeling. 

* We believe that the most essential relationship between people is exchange. The most essential function of money is the value scale and the medium of transaction. The wealth of every individual in the economic system does not depend on how many tokens he has but on the proportion of his wealth in the total social wealth. The reason for the existence of inflation is that the issuance of currency is not allocated to system participants fairly and reasonably. The average and proportionate allocation mechanism of this digital currency can achieve self-regulation. Based on this understanding of economics, we are prepared to build an economic system free of hyperinflation and deflation. In this economic system, a new currency allocation mechanism will be introduced to ensure the coexistence of fairness and efficiency and promote the sustainable operation of the system. 

* Unlike ordinary digital currencies, the number of ECHO is adjusted in real-time, and the supply is adjusted according to demand. Followed is our money supply adjustment mechanism, the DMM mechanism: each transaction behavior in the system will automatically trigger currency issuance in the amount of age number* adjustment coefficient.

* For example, Alice transfers 100W to Bob, and Bob provides Alice with an apple worth of 100W，then the system will automatically issue currency in the amount: 100W * 1 = 100W (assuming the adjustment coefficient is 1). The already Issued and unallocated currency will be distributed with POES. 

* An important concept is the allocation mechanism of new distribution model called POES, a portion (X%) of newly issued currency is allocated evenly to each period-active-receive account in the system, and the other (Y%) is allocated proportionately according to the period-active-received amount of each account (X%+Y%=100%), which is tentatively defined as X%=Y%=50%.

* To achieve the purpose of the adjustable amount of money, it is necessary not only to have a mechanism for currency issuance but also to have a mechanism for currency destruction. Only in this way can a dynamic balance of currency supply be achieved. Behavior such as transfers and evaluations of transactions will consume a certain amount of ECHO as fuel. The fuel here will be destroyed directly. Of course, the user's transaction is free, and the unallocated currency in the money pool is destroyed. Here, the currency is issued according to MI=transaction amount * adjustment coefficient N. The decrease of currency is mainly to consume a certain proportion of the transfer transaction amount of ECHO as fuel. Fuel=transaction amount* adjustment coefficient M. Net increase of currency= MI-fuel consumption at a certain moment. Here you only need to adjust the coefficients N and M to control the supply of money. 

* THALA is the fuel that drives the normal operation of the Thales system. It is also a digital asset with value storage capabilities. Because it has both price value and usage value, and a limited total amount, it will never be issued additionally. 

* **THALA allocation scheme**

* Name: THALA 
* Amount : 10,000,000,000(10 billion) .
* 10 %: team reserves. allocated evenly among technology, capital and operations committees.
* 90 %: mining award. used to reward miners.

* **ECHO allocation scheme**
* Name: ECHO 
* Amount: 10,000(10 thousand).
* The initial 10000 ECHO will be allocated to the THALA holders 

### Ecosystem Fit 

####  Why Thales and Polkadot need each other？
#####  Polkadot needs Thales 
* Polkadot is a blockchain infrastructure, and a large part of its value depends on the value of applications built on it that are closer to users. Thale's goal is to establish an algorithmic central bank based on Polkadot, and then create an algorithmic credit currency ECHO. Thales' goal is to become the Federal Reserve in the blockchain world, and ECHO's goal is to become the US dollar in the blockchain world. This is a new sociological experiment. If established successfully, Thales will bring a lot of users and transactions to the Polkadot ecosystem, and will gradually migrate the value of the physical financial world to the Polkadot ecosystem.

* As of now, the Polkadot ecological project has no similar projects to Thales. Many teams are preparing to establish USDT and MakerDAO in Polkadot. However, we believe that USDT corresponds to the gold standard of the physical world, and MarkerDAO corresponds to the Bretton Woods system of the physical world. All collapsed, and then entered the era of credit money. The same is true in the blockchain world. The next stage will be the era of algorithmic central banks and algorithmic credit currencies.

* What we are doing is that the Polkadot ecology does not exist but it is in the future.

#####   Thales needs Polkadot
* Polkadot is a good infrastructure that can solve our needs well, so that we don't need to reinvent the wheel, but focus on our own logic implementation.

#### Who needs Thales ？

##### DEX：
* Decentralized exchanges need to use blockchain-based pricing currencies as transaction pricing units. It is absurd for many exchanges to use USDT. Using DAI may be a better choice, but the design model of DAI determines his Supply is difficult to keep up with demand.

* Decentralized exchanges also need a blockchain-based transaction pricing unit. Thales uses our own design mechanism to build an open and transparent algorithmic central bank based on the blockchain and then issues credit currency ECHO based on the algorithm in the next year.ECHO grows completely with demand.

##### DEFI：
* This problem also exists in Defi applications. Many defi applications are still denominated in USD. 

* When our team was designing, we imagined the blockchain as a new country based on Internet technology. Then this country needs digital gold and digital currency. In this country, build a real application from the ground up. Currency is used as a medium of exchange and a measure of value. All the processes of such a currency are completely open, transparent, and traceable. Just such a currency is needed in the defi world.

##### Blockchain Business：
* All businesses have a transaction link, and large-scale transactions need a general equivalent. With the advancement of technology, the volume of business will continue to increase, and if it is priced in Bitcoin, it will lead to deflation for the entire business economy.

* The gold used to be the currency in the physical world corresponds to Bitcoin in the blockchain world.
* The Bretton Woods system in the physical world corresponds to MakerDAO in the blockchain world.
* The Federal Reserve (USD) in the physical world corresponds to the algorithmic central bank (algorithmic credit currency) in the blockchain world.

* Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to solve the problem of inflation in the physical world, so he created Bitcoin. Nakamoto's understanding of inflation is that the rapid increase in the number of currencies has caused a series of problems.

* But our team believes that quantity is not the essence, but  the percentage  is the essence. In fact, our team believes that the use of percentage pricing can reflect the nature of the price, not an absolute number. Inflation and deflation in fact do not have much impact on individuals. It is the distribution of new inflationary currencies that has caused huge problems. The currency transmission path of the traditional financial system of central bank-commercial bank-large enterprises-small enterprises-individuals has caused the wealth deprivation of individuals who obtained additional currency in the early period of the individuals who obtained the additional currency in the later period. Because in the early days, although the currency was issued more, the purchasing power of the currency did not depreciate accordingly.

* If we want blockchain commerce to achieve greater development, then a blockchain-based native algorithm credit currency is indispensable.

#### What problem does Thales solve? 
* In a decentralized world, there has never been such an urgent need for an algorithmic credit currency, because we know this is the future.

* We have always believed that Bitcoin is not a digital currency but a digital asset. Because the basic function of the currency is to serve as the transaction medium and value scale, while the basic function of assets is to maintain and increase value. People need assets as well as currency in their daily lives. We believe that the system can only be pushed forward with decentralized system currencies and assets as gas together to push the system continuously forward. However, the underlying economic logic of currency and assets is completely different and must be issued separately. 

* Given such economic understanding, we designed a parallel dual-currency economic system called Hayek, stable currency ECHO and digital asset THALA. This value stability is not like DAI, the anchored currency, nor USDT which is endorsed by the legal currency but achieved through a transparent issuance and destruction mechanism to strictly control the currency supply.

####  The difference between us and other non-collateralized stablecoins:

##### The first difference is: our design philosophy:
We imagine the blockchain world as a new country. This country needs a currency. How should this currency be designed?
All designs are trying to solve this problem.
First of all, inflation and deflation itself are not harmful to the economic system, because the essence of commodity pricing is a percentage price, so the problem is the distribution mechanism of the new inflation currency. Part of the additional currency is first obtained at a low cost. At this time, the purchasing power of the currency has not depreciated, so it is an exploitation of latecomers.
So as long as the distribution mechanism is fair, there is no time delay, and the inflation and deflation of the currency are based on a clear, open and transparent rule, then the blockchain can be used to create a fair non-collateralized stablecoin.

##### The second difference is: the model of inflation and deflation:
Currency inflation and deflation need to have a parameter indicator, this parameter indicator needs to represent the demand for money and the amount of token economy. The simplest indicator we can think of is trading. Inflation and deflation in the Thales system are based on transactions.
Unlike ordinary digital currencies, the number of ECHO is adjusted in real-time, and the supply is adjusted according to demand. Followed is our money supply adjustment mechanism, the DMM mechanism: each transaction behavior in the system will automatically trigger currency issuance in the amount of age number* adjustment coefficient.
For example, Alice transfers 100W to Bob, and Bob provides Alice with an apple worth of 100W，then the system will automatically issue currency in the amount: 100W * 1 = 100W (assuming the adjustment coefficient is 1). 

##### The third difference is: distribution model:
We have designed a distribution model based on value contribution to simulate the real society, 50% is distributed equally, and 50% is distributed according to the proportion of the collection amount in a period.
An important concept is the allocation mechanism of new distribution-model called POES, a portion (X%) of newly issued currency is allocated evenly to each period-active-receive account in the system, and the other (Y%) is allocated proportionately according to the period-active-received amount of each account (X%+Y%=100%), which is tentatively defined as X%=Y%=50%.
To achieve the purpose of the adjustable amount of money, it is necessary not only to have a mechanism for currency issuance but also to have a mechanism for currency destruction. Only in this way can a dynamic balance of currency supply be achieved. Behavior such as transfers and evaluations of transactions will consume a certain amount of ECHO as fuel. The fuel here will be destroyed directly. Of course, the user's transaction is free, and the unallocated currency in the money pool is destroyed. Here, the currency is issued according to MI=transaction amount*adjustment coefficient N. The decrease of currency is mainly to consume a certain proportion of the transfer transaction amount of ECHO as fuel. Fuel=transaction amount* adjustment coefficient M. Net increase of currency= MI-fuel consumption at a certain moment. Here you only need to adjust the coefficients N and M to control the supply of money. 

##### The fourth difference is: the original intention of the system design
Our original intention was not to create a currency anchored to the US dollar USD. We are designing a new currency for a new country. As a new currency, it can maintain a certain exchange rate with the US dollar USD, but it has its own Inflation deflation and distribution model. We are adapting to the currency needs of this new country and the size of the economy, rather than handing over the leadership to the US dollar.
